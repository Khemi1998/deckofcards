# DeckCards-mini-project

## Purpose

A mini challenge with the purpose of familarising myself with react. I chose a plain style as I wanted to focus on the map aspect of the project. I plan to come back to this project to add a button that shuffles the deck and change the designs for the king, queen and jacks.

###Challenge
<ul>
<li>There is a gist with the data you need below</li>
<li>Create a new file in data and copy the array of card Objects into it</li>
<li>Create a reusable component to display each CARD object in the array</li>
<li>Map over the data file and create a component for each object</li>
<li>Map over the data file and create a component for each object</li>
<li>Add some conditional styles based on suit</li>
EXTENSION: Can you shuffle the deck before mapping? 
</ul>
